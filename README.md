### Well data recipes

- [Adding a deviation survey to a well](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Adding%20a%20deviation%20survey%20to%20a%20well.ipynb) : Complete, but could be expanded. Needs more description.

### Legend recipes
- [Creating a legend from an image](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Creating%20a%20legend%20from%20an%20image.ipynb): Complete.

- [Creating a legend from csv](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Creating%20a%20legend%20from%20csv.ipynb): Complete. Could improve by importing csv reader. Currently just reads legend as string.

- [Manipulating colors within a default legend](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Manipulating%20colors%20within%20a%20default%20legend.ipynb): Complete, but could expand and show how to edit hatches, widths, make copies of defaults, etc.

### Striplog recipes
- [Creating a striplog from an image](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Creating%20a%20striplog%20from%20an%20image.ipynb): NOT COMPLETE. Export final results to LAS format

- [Crop striplogs using tops](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Crop%20striplogs%20using%20tops.ipynb): Complete.


- [Making a striplog from one of Peter Giles images] (https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Making%20a%20striplog%20from%20one%20of%20Peter%20Giles%20images.ipynb): Complete


- [Make petrophysical data from a striplog](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Make%20petrophysical%20logs%20from%20a%20striplog.ipynb): NOT COMPLETE. Add final steps to export to LAS format.

- [Making a striplog from tops.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Making%20a%20striplog%20from%20tops.ipynb): Complete, but could enhance graphical outputs / annotations.

- [Handling side wall core data](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Handling%20sidewall%20core%20data.ipynb): Complete.

- [Filtering a log with a striplog](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Filtering%20a%20log%20with%20a%20striplog.ipynb): Complete.

- [Working with core photographs](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Working%20with%20core%20photographs.ipynb): NOT COMPLETE. Cursory proof of concept not yet integrated into Welly or Striplog.

### Recipes ToDo

- Adding multiple LAS files to a well

- Working with photomicrograph images

- Working with XRF tabular data

- Applying point data to stratigraphic intervals

- Incorporating multiple striplog and lasfile objects in a well

- Composite plot configurations
