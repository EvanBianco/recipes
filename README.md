# Well data recipes

- [Adding a deviation survey to a well](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Adding%20a%20deviation%20survey%20to%20a%20well.ipynb) : COMPLETE, but could be expanded

# Legend recipes
- [Creating a legend from an image](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Creating%20a%20legend%20from%20an%20image.ipynb): COMPLETE. but need to work get working with no gaps

- [Creating a legend from csv](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Creating%20a%20legend%20from%20csv.ipynb): COMPLETE (could use more description / explanation)

- [Manipulating colors within a default legend](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Manipulating%20colors%20within%20a%20default%20legend.ipynb): COMPLETE but could expand

# Striplog recipes
- [Creating a striplog from an image](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Creating%20a%20striplog%20from%20an%20image.ipynb): NOT COMPLETE. Export final results to LAS format

- [Crop striplogs using tops](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Crop%20striplogs%20using%20tops.ipynb): COMPLETE.


- [Making a striplog from one of Peter Giles images.ipynb] (https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Making%20a%20striplog%20from%20one%20of%20Peter%20Giles%20images.ipynb): COMPLETE


- [Make petrophysical data from a striplog](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/recipes/blob/master/Make%20petrophysical%20logs%20from%20a%20striplog.ipynb): NOT COMPLETE. Could remove redudant first part from creating striplog from image. Add steps to export to LAS format.

- [Making a striplog from tops.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Making%20a%20striplog%20from%20tops.ipynb): COMPLETE but needs descriptions

## Recipes To Do

- Working with photomicrograph images

- Working with core photograph images

- Working with non-uniformly sampled point data

- Applying point data to stratigraphic intervals

- Incorporating multiple striplog and lasfile objects in a well

- Composite plotting

- Filtering a petrophysical log using a striplog
